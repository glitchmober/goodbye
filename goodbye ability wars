its been a good 6-8 months in ability wars, I honestly believe that I had some fun
if i could do it all over again I would, but i cant.
All i caused was unwanted arguments and caused so much
uneeded shit in the server. This is why I will be taking my leave
Most of you wont give a shit, this is towards those I care
about the most and those who have been on my side.
I feel like its time to take a break from everything
in general. thanks for the fun times for these 7 months -glitch :)
