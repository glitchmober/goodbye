well, ive enjoyed these past 3 years on discord, 
ive met a lot of cool people, even some non cool
people, its been a very fun journey, if i could
do it all over again I would. but, its time for me
to take a very long break and decide what im doing
as a person and who i am. its been tough for
the last 3 months as i figured out i was diagnosed with
cancer. il make sure to never give up for all
of my friends and family. thank you, for everything 
thank you for giving me a chance to see the world
and meet such great people. - glitchmob
